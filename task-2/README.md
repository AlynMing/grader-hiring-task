### Instructions

This task is a mock-up of what you will be doing when grading assignments. 

We've have five different submissions from our students which you need to grade. We have used modified student submissions to give you an idea of how submissions will look like on the job. We have incorporated almost all possible scenarios you can encounter while grading actual submissions.

In this task, you will be grading the students using a spreadsheet but in actual scenario, you will use the company platform to grade assignments. 

Go over the files in each folder. Read each thoroughly. The main task in each folder is found in grading-rubric.md. Make sure to complete the tasks for both Android and Web.
