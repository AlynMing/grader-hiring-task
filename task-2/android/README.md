### Context 

Our AND101 students will work on a project called Kotlin Debug-a-thon. In this assignment, students will debug and fix a broken app by modifying Kotlin code. By the end of this assignment, students are expected to: 
- Understand basic Kotlin syntax (variables, functions, classes)
- Debug basic errors in Android Studio
- Refactor Kotlin code

In this task, there is no need for you to check the source code. You will only be referring to the demo submitted by the student. Take note that if the GIF (or video) is not present or there is no way for you to give a score, always set the score to zero. For you to easily grade submissions, you will be using a grading rubric.

### Grading Guide

All CodePath assignments will have a grading guide. This guide will serve as our basis in giving points - full points or partial points. Check out each feature below and how we should be grading each feature shown in the video. 

**Feature 1: üëã Debug and fix navigation to Hello World activity**<br>
When the "Hello World" button is clicked, the app should display a screen with the Hello World text. **Assign 2 points**.

**Feature 2: 4Ô∏è‚É£ Debug and fix Number Sum (2 + 2) activity**<br>
When the "Number Sum (2 + 2)" button is clicked, the app should display a screen with the answer: 4. Any other number is acceptable as long as it is the sum of the numbers shown in the button. **Assign 2 points**

**Feature 3: üìÖ  Debug and fix Current Day activity**<br>
When the "Current Day" button is clicked, the app should display a screen with current day of the week. Any number between 1 or 31 is acceptable. **Assign 3 points.**

**Feature 4: üåà Debug and fix behavior of Random Color activity**<br>
When the "Random Color" button is clicked, the app should display a white screen that changes color each time the screen is clicked. **Assign 1 point if only one color other than white is shown. Assign 2 points if atleast two colors other white are shown**. 

**Feature 5: üóíÔ∏è Debug and fix Print List activity**<br>
When the "Print List" button is clicked, the app should display a screen with the words "this is your standard immutable list" printed, one word per line. **Assign 3 points**.

**Feature 6: üíØ Debug and fix Favorite Number activity**<br>
When the "Favorite Number" button is clicked, the app should display a screen with the student's favorite number. Any number is acceptale. **Assign 3 points.**


### Grading Rubric

Our graders use a grading rubric to easily grade submissions. The grading rubric is a spreadsheet which contains the member ID of the student, full name, list of features and the corresponding possible implementation. It also has some Yes or No questions you need to answer. 

The grading rubric will have two tabs - - AND101 and WEB101. Refer to `AND101` tab for this task. The grading rubric also has parts for evaluation. These are:

- **GIF evaluation**. Evaluate if there is a GIF and if it is valid. A valid GIF means that there is **at least one feature fully shown** in the recording.
- **README.md evaluation**. Evaluate if the README file used by the student has used the correct README template. Refer to the template folder for the AND101 README. Evaluate if the features implemented by the student are checked in the README.
- **Submission Status**. There are three different types of status - complete, incomplete, complete late and complete late excused.
    - **Complete**. A submission is complete if it is submitted prior to the deadline.
    - **Incomplete**. Incomplete if there is no way for you to give points.
    - **Complete Late**. Complete Late if the assignment is submitted after the deadline.
    - **Complete Late Excused**. Complete late excused means that the assignment is submitted past the deadline but it tagged excused by the assigned coordinators. 

### Your task

In this task, you will be grading sample submissions. As mentioned you do not need to check the source code. Rather, you will only be grading the assignment based on the GIF or video submitted by the student. Follow these steps in executing this task. 

- [ ] Create a copy of your [grading rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHJM5jPEMFxeXrpjcBi6fN50tZFXW2JWcT_4xTtLc7A). Add your name to the file name _(i.e. Grading Hiring Task 2 + Alyn Rosell)_
- [ ] Update sharing to anyone with the link can view. Take note of the link and share it with us.
- [ ] Refer to the following submissions made by your students.
      
  - [Student 1: AND101-01](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-01)
  - [Student 2: AND101-02](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-02)
  - [Student 3: AND101-03](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-03)
  - [Student 4: AND101-04](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-04)
  - [Student 5: AND101-05](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-05)
      
- [ ] Evaluate the README of each submission. Click the box if it's YES or NO.
- [ ] Evaluate the GIF. Click the box if it's YES or NO.
- [ ] Evaluate feature implementation. Select from column F (Features) the implementation shown in the GIF. You can only select one per feature.

**Things to Note:** <br>
You will only be mostly checking the boxes. Please refrain from making any changes on the other cells since.
