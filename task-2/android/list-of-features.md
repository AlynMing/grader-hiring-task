Our AND102 students will work on a project called Wordle. In this project, students will build a simple version of the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). By the end of this assignment, students are expected to: 

- Gain more familiarity with the programming language Kotlin
- Build screen layouts using ConstraintLayout
- Understand how to handle user interaction
- Understand how to process user input using EditText
- Understand how to update UI (User Interface) based on user interaction


In this task, there is no need for you to check the source code. You will only be referring to the demo submitted by the student. Take note that if the GIF (or video) is not present or there is no way for you to give a score, always set the score to zero. For you to easily grade submissions, you will be using a grading rubric.

### AND102 Assignment: Wordle

All CodePath assignments will have a grading guide. This guide will serve as our basis in giving points - full points or partial points. Check out each feature below and how we should be grading each feature shown in the video. 

The following are required features

- [ ] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word** 
- [ ] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [ ] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [ ] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**

The following are optional features.

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word 
- [ ] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word
- [ ] User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
- [ ] User will get an error message if they input an invalid guess
- [ ] User can see a 'streak' record of how many words they've guessed correctly.
