Our AND102 students will work on a project called Wordle. In this project, students will build a simple version of the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). By the end of this assignment, students are expected to: 

- Gain more familiarity with the programming language Kotlin
- Build screen layouts using ConstraintLayout
- Understand how to handle user interaction
- Understand how to process user input using EditText
- Understand how to update UI (User Interface) based on user interaction


In this task, there is no need for you to check the source code. You will only be referring to the demo submitted by the student. Take note that if the GIF (or video) is not present or there is no way for you to give a score, always set the score to zero. For you to easily grade submissions, you will be using a grading rubric.

### AND102 Assignment: Wordle

All CodePath assignments will have a grading guide. This guide will serve as our basis in giving points - full points or partial points. Check out each feature below and how we should be grading each feature shown in the video. 

The following are required features

- [ ] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word** 
- [ ] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [ ] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [ ] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**

The following are optional features.

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word 
- [ ] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word
- [ ] User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
- [ ] User will get an error message if they input an invalid guess
- [ ] User can see a 'streak' record of how many words they've guessed correctly.

### Grading Rubric

Our graders use a grading rubric to easily grade submissions. The grading rubric is a spreadsheet which contains the member ID of the student, full name, list of features and the corresponding possible implementation. It also has some Yes or No questions you need to answer. 

The grading rubric will have two tabs - - AND101 and WEB101. Refer to `AND101` tab for this task. The grading rubric also has parts for evaluation. These are:

- **GIF evaluation**. Evaluate if there is a GIF and if it is valid. A valid GIF means that there is **at least one feature fully shown** in the recording.
- **README.md evaluation**. Evaluate if the README file used by the student has used the correct README template. Refer to the template folder for the AND101 README. Evaluate if the features implemented by the student are checked in the README.
- **Submission Status**. There are three different types of status - complete, incomplete, complete late and complete late excused.
    - **Complete**. A submission is complete if it is submitted prior to the deadline.
    - **Incomplete**. Incomplete if there is no way for you to give points.
    - **Complete Late**. Complete Late if the assignment is submitted after the deadline.
    - **Complete Late Excused**. Complete late excused means that the assignment is submitted past the deadline but it tagged excused by the assigned coordinators. 

### Your task

In this task, you will be grading sample submissions. As mentioned you do not need to check the source code. Rather, you will only be grading the assignment based on the GIF or video submitted by the student. Follow these steps in executing this task. 

- [ ] Create a copy of your [grading rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHJM5jPEMFxeXrpjcBi6fN50tZFXW2JWcT_4xTtLc7A/copy). Add your name to the file name _(i.e. Grading Hiring Task 2 + Alyn Rosell)_
- [ ] Update sharing to anyone with the link can view. Take note of the link and share it with us.
- [ ] Refer to the following submissions made by your students.
      
  - [Student 1: AND101-01](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-01)
  - [Student 2: AND101-02](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-02)
  - [Student 3: AND101-03](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-03)
  - [Student 4: AND101-04](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-04)
  - [Student 5: AND101-05](https://github.com/AlynMing/AND101-05)
      
- [ ] Evaluate the README of each submission. Check the box if the README is correct. 
- [ ] Evaluate the GIF. Check the box if the feature is shown in the demo. 
- [ ] Evaluate feature implementation. Select from column F (Features) the implementation shown in the GIF. You can only select one per feature.

**Things to Note:** <br>
You will only be mostly checking the boxes. Please refrain from making any changes on the other cells. These are with formula. Any error made to the spreadsheet must be fixed prior to sending your hiring task.
