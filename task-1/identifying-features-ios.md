# Identifying Features - IOS

CodePath offers an introductory course in IOS. In this assignment, students will be submitting a Github repository in our platform. Included in the submission is a demo video (or GIF), the README.md containing the feature checklist and the source code. The video will showcase all the features that the student has implemented or completed in the assignment. The student must also check off the features they completed in the README.md file.

In this assignment, the students will submit a README.md file with the following list of features:
| Feature Description                                                            | How to Grade?                                                                                                                                              |

| App displays a keyboard on the screen                                          | The GIF should show the keyboard on the screen.                                                                                                            |
| When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)   | There should now be tapping on a keyboard cell and have the letter shown or deleted on the board.                                                          |
| User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time   | It should now be a basic Wordle app that has a different goal word each time you run the app.                                                              |
| Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon | The GIF recording should show the app from launch so as to demonstrate the app icon and, when launching, should also show a launch screen. |
| Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator                           | The GIF shows the app is being run on a real device.                                                                                                       |
